# MunicipalApp

### Overview
MunicipalApp is a WPF-based desktop application aimed at improving user engagement with municipal services. The application allows users to report issues, view local events and announcements, track service request statuses, and much more. The app leverages advanced data structures for optimized searching and event management while incorporating modern aesthetics to enhance user experience.

## Features
1. **Report Issues**: 
   - Users can report issues such as sanitation, road, or utility problems.
   - The form includes fields for location, category, description, and file attachments.
   
2. **Local Events and Announcements**:
   - Users can search for upcoming local events based on categories, dates, or keywords.
   - Events are organized using a **SortedDictionary** for efficient retrieval, and a **HashSet** is used to manage unique categories.
   - Recommendations based on user search history are provided using **Queue** to track search patterns.
   
3. **Service Request Status**: *(Feature under development)*

## Technologies Used
- **WPF (.NET Framework)**: The front-end framework for designing the application interface.
- **C#**: The programming language used for the back-end logic.
- **SortedDictionary, HashSet, and Queue**: Advanced data structures for efficient event storage, search, and recommendations.
- **Stripe Integration**: Payment gateway for future functionality to handle municipal payments.
